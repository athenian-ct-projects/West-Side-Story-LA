        "This is a game/quiz for the West Side Story focus day. You will be asked some general questions and some personal questions. For the general questions (like answer yes or no, or answer 1 or 2) you will need to type it exactly how it is presented, capital letters are not needed and don't use them. At the end there will be a collective list of the questions you answered and feel free to take a picture with a phone or iPad. This information is very useful and a good thing to study. If there is a syntax error you will need to restart. Thanks and enjoy!\n",
